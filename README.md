# Reco

Reco is an audio recording app designed for elementary OS.

Features include:

* **Recording sounds from both your microphone and system at the same time.** This would be useful when you record conversations with chat apps or stream videos on the Internet
* **Saving in some commonly used formats.** It supports AAC, FLAC, MP3, Ogg Vorbis, Opus, and WAV
* **Timed recording.** You can set a delay before recording up to 15 seconds, and the length of recording up to 600 seconds
* **Autosaving or always-ask-where-to-save workflow.** You can select whether the app saves recordings automatically or you choose a destination each time on saving them
* **Saving recording when the app quits.** Even if you happen to quit the app while recording, the recording is saved automatically or a FileChooserDialog is shown depends on your saving setting

## The Story Behind This App

One day, I had to take minutes for a meeting in my department with my elementary laptop. The discussion was so fast-paced, though, that I couldn't listen and write down everything in the minutes. When I got home, I searched for a sound recorder app. I found some non-elementary apps like GNOME Sound Recorder, but there were none for elementary OS. Thus, I decided to create one designed for elementary OS.
